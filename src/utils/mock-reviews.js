      "Cyberpunk 2077 is a game that feels like a constant emotional elevator. Endowed with a moment of grace capable of making a lasting mark on players and the industry in general, with prospects for deep approaches, which only reveal themselves according to your investment, an incredible staging, writing that's Flawless and jaw-dropping, lovingly crafted, CD Projekt's RPG is as striking in its lack of finish, which is often hard to excuse for a game of this stature.",

      "Dealing with themes like religion, racism, and xenophobia, Columbia is a richer and more nuanced setting than even Rapture, and the unveiling of the cityâ€™s culture is masterfully executed.",
